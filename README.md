# Thyroid-cancer-detection

(Bournemouth University project)

In this project, I trained multiple machine learning models to predict thyroid cancer risk and then used the expected risk to help determine whether the cancer is benign or malignant.

Iâ€™ve also generated a report that includes the code, allowing you to view which models were trained, their outputs, and the time it took to train each model. This project serves as a comparison of how different models perform with slight changes using the same dataset.
